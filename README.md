# SEO-Grade-System



### üó∫ Skills Map for SEO  
This guide on grading will help you progress from Junior to Head level by developing the specific skills your company needs. A grading system allows for a transparent way to increase or decrease salaries. You must clearly match the level at which you are classified.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Introduction  
I‚Äôve compiled everything you need to move from Junior SEO to HEAD in one repository. This system is easily scalable for other roles like product manager, project manager, developers, etc. It‚Äôs particularly useful if your team includes more than 10 members, such as SEOs, developers, and others. For smaller teams, you may need to significantly adapt it to your context.

### ü§ñ How-to-Use  

This guide is meant for leaders or managers. Leaders should convey the values and requirements to their team members.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Adapting the System**  
This template suits my team, but you must adapt it to yours. Key elements to adapt include:  

- **Grades**:  
  Adjust the columns *Required Level* and *Salary* in the "Grades" folder. Define the skills needed to progress from Junior to Middle, and so on.  

- **Competencies**:  
  In the "Competence" folder, determine which competencies are crucial for your company or use mine. Specify the list of skills for each competency and describe them. For example, define what a Junior, Middle, or Senior should be capable of for each skill.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Conducting Evaluations**  

1. Ask the employee to prepare a feedback form and share it with people they‚Äôve worked with in the past six months, such as analysts, developers, or managers. The employee should compile these evaluations into a single file.  
   - Don‚Äôt forget **self-assessment**! Provide assessment templates from the "Personal Development Plan" folder. Tailor templates for each role to avoid irrelevant questions (e.g., product managers should not face developer-specific questions).  

2. Create a shared file or page where the employee lists their goals and achievements from the past quarter or half-year. Include a table with all skills, explained below.  

3. Meet with the employee. Follow the meeting guidelines in the "Cookbook" folder.  
   - Review each skill and its evaluations. Assign a final score and determine the employee's grade based on the requirements in the "Grades" folder.  
   - Identify lagging skills (no more than three). Let the employee choose which to focus on, while reminding them of company/business goals.  
   - Develop a growth plan for these skills.

4. Spend 5‚Äì10 minutes discussing salary, and you‚Äôre done!

### üèÅ Summary  

- You and the employee know their grade.  
- Weak skills are identified.  
- Salary agreements are transparent, based on grade and skills.  
- A development plan for the next quarter is in place.

### ü§ü Why a Grading System is Awesome  

- You can easily train a Junior to reach the next level since all requirements are documented.  
- Your grading system doubles as a training system.  
- Flexibility: Shift training focus toward product management, project management, analytics, or development. Your SEO specialist could potentially transition into one of these roles.
